# Babol

Babol is a work in progress with the goal of making music sharing across services as easy as it should be. Want to share a Spotify link with a friend who uses Apple Music, Babol's got your back.

# User Stories

+ A user sharing music should be able to input a link from a Babol-supported music platform and obtain a Babol permalink listing links to that piece of content on all Babol-supported music platforms.
+ A user consuming a Babol link should be able to access that piece of content on her music platform of choice (provided that it is supported by Babol).
+ A user consuming a Babol link should automatically be redirected to her music platform after the first time.
